3 types

1. Cofiguration management          ex: Ansible, Puppet, Salt Stack
    -> To install, mng software on existing infrastructure
    -> Maintains standard structure and Version Control.
    -> Idempotent (same behavior how many times u run)

2. Server templatig                 ex: docker, Packer, Vagrant
    -> Preinstalled softwares and dependencies(VM/docker images)
    -> immutable infrastructure

3. Provisioning tools               ex: terraform, cloudFormation
    -> By simple declarative code, Provisioning of infrastructure.
    -> CF provides UI, templates for easy provision of resources in AWS.
    -> TF supports all major CSP, and many more...

We can use config mng tools for Provisioning
        can write ansible playbook to launch ec2 instances(using ec2 module)

=> this should be avoided as there is no state management[it's based on procedural approach]
[it'll create new instance in every run, it won't check if it already exists](possible to check if already exists by adding another tag)[exact_count: 2]
have to write some more lines for deleting them (with tf it's easy -> terraform destroy )
